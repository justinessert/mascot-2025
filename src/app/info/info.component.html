        <h2>📖 How It Started</h2>
        <p>
            The origin of this project started when I was in high school and wanted to get my sister to create a march
            madness bracket.
            To convince her, we decided to create a shared bracket where we picked which mascot we liked the best.
            After a few years of moving Google Images windows around as we manually filled out a bracket, I decided to
            create some utilities to make this process easier.
            For the first couple years of this tool, it was something that could only run on my laptop, and was quite
            clunky to set up.
            After requests from other friends and family to get access to the tool, I decided to port it into a website.
            This website represents the latest iteration of that tool.
